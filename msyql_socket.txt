For TCP and UDP networks, addresses have the form host[:port]. If port is omitted, 
the default port will be used. If host is a literal IPv6 address, it must be enclosed in square brackets. 
The functions net.JoinHostPort and net.SplitHostPort manipulate addresses in this form.

For Unix domain sockets the address is the absolute path to the MySQL-Server-socket, 
e.g. /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock or /tmp/mysql.sock.
